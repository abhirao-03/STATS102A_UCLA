Include an algorithm or flowchart:

### Algorithm Name:
1. Steps
2. Go
3. Here

### Flowchart

The following line shows you how to embed images in-line. This assumes that your
homework folder also contains an Images directory where you will store all of 
the images. Delete this line if you don't have an image to test, so your file 
will knit.

### Test Cases
```{r GCD_test_cases}
c(gcd(72, 8) == 8, gcd(-1, 531) == 1, gcd(47011, 73618) == 1)
```

```{r LCM_test_cases}
c(lcm(c(-12, 21)) == 84, lcm(c(4789, 6123, 199)) == 5835286353)
```
